## File Parser

A fresh php developer was given the task to write a file parser to parse the content of any given file and return its content as a php array. 

For a first step, he was asked to parse only json and xml files.

This repo represents his implementation. A Senior developer in the same company reviewed it and did not like it. 

## Task

Your task is to evaluate this implementation and implement it in your way.

- What are your thoughts about? What are the good things? the bad ones?
- How would you implement it?

## How to send your solution?

1 - First of all and after cloning this repo, create your own branch. 
> To guarrantee a unique branch name and prevent conflicts, 
please name your branch after your email address. `example: git checkout -b anass.rakibi@gmail.com` 
> 
> Other formats won't be consider it. In addition pushing to the develop branch is not allowed.

2 - Add a `SOLUTION.md` file to your branch, where you write your remarks and explain your solution (if needed)

3 - After making your changes and to make sure everything is still working as expected, you can run the tests. 
``` php vendor/bin/phpunit tests ``` from the root of your directory

## Important notices.

1 - To have enough time to review your solution, I set the next friday: 19-02-2021 at 22:00 (Moroccan Time) to be the deadline for submitting your solution
